## What Are Mokens?

Technically mokens are [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) compliant and [ERC998](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-998.md) compliant non-fungible tokens minted on the main Ethereum network from the [Mokens contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaaf401585b72c678afc09036510d3ef759bdaf7e).

Mokens are general purpose non-fungible tokens that are designed for projects to use.

The Mokens community consists of all the people involved in some way with mokens.

The Mokens project is the Mokens community plus all the software, websites, documentation and other information related to mokens.

## Goals

_The goal of the Mokens project is mass adoption by the general public of NFTs and dapps on the Ethereum blockchain._

The Mokens project shares this goal with all projects that want to acheive it. We invite all people and projects to work with us to acheive this common goal. If this is your goal or something you want then we want to work with you.

All NFTs and dapps benefit from acheiving this goal. 

The Mokens project intends to help achieve this goal by being a bridge between non-crypto websites with millions of users and dapps on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Mokens project will provide a complete turn-key cryptocollectible solution (mokens) that is easily integrated with formly non-crypto websites that have millions of users.

The Mokens project plans to integrate mokens with existing and new crypto projects that utilize mokens in valuable way.

To acheive this goal here are some of the activities and objectives of the Mokens project:
1. Implement technology, methods, plans and activities to make mokens desirable and useful as cryptocollectibles and non-fungible tokens.
2. Find and create more use cases for mokens.
3. Find people willing to join the Mokens community and help with the various activities and sub-projects.
4. Find and help integrate mokens with projects, such as Ethereum-based games and systems.
5. Start, support and encourage new projects that use mokens.
5. Support, help, promote and market projects and people that are using mokens.
6. Create and assist in the creation of new websites, software, user-interfaces and tools related to mokens.
7. Create the documentation, blog posts, videos, pod casts and other media to accurately educate and inform the public about mokens and their uses to their benefit.
