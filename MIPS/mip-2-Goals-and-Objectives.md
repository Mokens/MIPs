## What Are Mokens?

Technically mokens are [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) compliant and [ERC998](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-998.md) compliant non-fungible tokens minted on the main Ethereum network from the [Mokens contract](https://mokens.io/about/mokens-contract).

Mokens are general purpose non-fungible tokens and cryptocollectibles.

The Mokens community consists of all the people involved in some way with mokens.

The Mokens project is the Mokens community plus all the software, websites, documentation and other information related to mokens.

## Goals

_The goal of the Mokens project is to create valuable cryptocollectibles that are traded among collecters._

The Mokens project provides a customizable cryptocollectibles solution (mokens) that is easily integrated with formally non-crypto websites and crypto-based systems and games.

The Mokens project plans to integrate mokens with existing and new crypto projects that utilize mokens in useful or valuable ways.

Here are motivations:
1. Non-crypto websites want to integrate mokens into their website because the technical Ethereum work to create, manage and support cryptocollectibes is done by the Mokens project. In other words integrating mokens is relatively low risk, low cost and low effort. In addition mokens has or will have many uses in existing and new Ethereum dapps. The Mokens project offers non-crypto websites a way to introduce their users to the future, dapps on the blockchain.
2. Ethereum-based projects are interested in integrating mokens in useful ways in order to access and provide service to the flow of new people minting or acquiring or using mokens.

Be one of the first projects to integrate mokens. Talk to us on the [Mokens discord](https://discord.gg/ZyaqFhE).

Here are general plans and activities of the Mokens project:
1. Implement technology, methods, plans and activities to make mokens desirable and useful as cryptocollectibles and non-fungible tokens.
2. Find and create more use cases for mokens.
3. Find people willing to join the Mokens community and help with the various activities and sub-projects.
4. Find and help integrate mokens with new and existing crypto projects, such as Ethereum-based games and systems.
5. Find non-crypto websites and software and companies that are interested in introducing their users to cryptocollectibles and help them integrate mokens.
5. Start, support and encourage new projects that use mokens.
5. Support, help, promote and market projects and people that are using mokens.
6. Create and assist in the creation of new websites, software, user-interfaces and tools related to mokens.
7. Create the documentation, blog posts, videos, pod casts and other media to accurately educate and inform the public about mokens and their uses to their benefit.
