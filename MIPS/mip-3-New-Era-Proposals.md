## New Era Proposals

Anybody can submit a New Era Proposal at any time by creating an issue with a title that starts with "New Era Proposal".

A New Era Proposal should consist of the following:
1. The name of the author.
2. The date the proposed new era would start.
3. The name of the era. The era name is a word or phrase that brands the tokens of the era. The era name must be 32 ASCII characters or shorter.
4. The starting mint price.
5. The mint increase amount.
6. The rationale for the era. 

New eras should help the Mokens project in some way and the rational of a proposed era should explain how it helps the Mokens project.   

Here are some important points to consider when writing a New Era Proposal:
1. Does the proposed era help get mokens accepted and integrated with other Ethereum projects?
2. Will the proposed era cause more people to adopt mokens?
3. Does the proposed era distinguish itself from past eras?
4. Will the proposed era satisfy existing moken holders (molders)?
5. Does the proposed era support or assit projects that use mokens?
6. Is the proposed era exciting and interesting and useful for something?
7. Does the proposed era balance moken scarcity: increase moken supply if they are too scarce or reduce moken supply when there are too many.
