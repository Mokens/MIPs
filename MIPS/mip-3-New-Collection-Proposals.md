## What is a Moken Collection?

A moken 'collection' is a name/label/branding/status for newly minted mokens. For example there could be a Roman collection. Mokens about Roman people and things would be created for the roman collection. The collection is stored with each moken in the Mokens contract and can be queried. 

The price for minting and buying is affected by which collection a moken is part of.

A New Collection Proposal is a way to propose a new moken collection.

## Creating New Collection Proposals

Anybody can submit a New Collection Proposal at any time by [creating an issue](https://github.com/Mokens/MIPs/issues/new) with a title that starts with "New Collection Proposal".

A New Collection Proposal should consist of the following:
1. The name of the author.
2. The name of the collection. The collection name must be 32 ASCII characters or shorter. 
3. The status of the proposal, either "draft" or "active".   
4. The date the proposed collection would start.
5. The starting mint price.
6. The mint increase amount, if any.
7. The rationale for the category. Who would make mokens for this category?

### Status

The status is "draft" until the author feels the proposal is complete and final. The author changes the status to "active" when he/she feels it is ready.

### Rational

The purpose of the Mokens project is to make many valuable cryptocollectibles and to facilitate their trade, usefulness and dissemination.

New collections should help the Mokens project in some way and the rational of a proposed era should explain how it helps the Mokens project.   

Here are examples of things to consider when writing a New Collections Proposal:
1. Does the proposed collection help get mokens accepted and integrated with other Ethereum projects?
2. Will the proposed collection cause more people to adopt mokens?
3. Does the proposed collection distinguish itself from past collections?
4. Will the proposed collection satisfy existing moken holders (molders)?
5. Does the proposed collection support or assist projects that use mokens?
6. Is the proposed collection exciting and interesting and useful for something?
7. Who would mint mokens for this collection?
