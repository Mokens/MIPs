## What is a MIP?

MIP stands for Moken Improvement Proposal. A MIP is a document providing information to the Mokens community and general public.

A MIP can be about a variety of things including the following:
1. A MIP can be informative, describing some part or aspect of the Mokens project.
2. A MIP can describe a process for managing mokens or some part of the Mokens project.
2. A MIP can describe the steps for doing something technical related to mokens. Tutorial.
3. A MIP can descibe software and technical details for integrating or using mokens.

MIPs are modeled on [Ethereum's EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).

To create a MIP clone this project, make your MIP and then submit a pull request. Each MIP should have a header similar in format to this one.

In some cases it may be a good idea to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Mokens/MIPs/issues/new) to this repository about your idea for a MIP to get feedback about it before you create the actual MIP.

When making an issue about a possible MIP make the starting of its title "Moken Request for Comment".

A MIP with the status of "Draft" is still being developed and is not in force yet.  A MIP with the status of "Active" is in force.

It is possible to update an "Active" MIP.
