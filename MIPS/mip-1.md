## What is a MIP?

MIP stands for Moken Improvement Proposal. A MIP is a document providing information to the Mokens community and general public.

A MIP can be a variety of things including the following:
1. A MIP can be informative, describing some part or aspect of the Mokens project.
2. A MIP can describe a process for managing mokens or some part of the Mokens project.
2. A MIP can describe the steps for doing something technical related to mokens. Tutorial.
3. A MIP can descibe software and technical details for integrating or using mokens.

MIPs are modeled on [Ethereum's EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).

## What Are Mokens?

Technically mokens are [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) compliant and [ERC998](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-998.md) compliant non-fungible tokens minted on the main Ethereum network from the [Mokens contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaaf401585b72c678afc09036510d3ef759bdaf7e).

The Mokens community consists of all the people involved in someway with mokens.

The Mokens project is the Mokens community plus all the software, websites, documentation and communication related to mokens.

## Goals

The goal of the Mokens project is to achieve wide-spread adoption and use of mokens among Ethereum users and Ethereum projects.

To acheive this goal here are some of the activities and objectives of the Mokens project:
1. Implement technology, methods, plans and activities to make mokens desirable and useful as crytpocollectibles and non-fungible tokens.
2. Find and create more usecases for mokens.
3. Find people willing to join the Mokens community and help with the various activities and sub-projects.
4. Find and help integrate mokens with other projects, such as Ethereum-based games and systems.
5. Assist in the creation of new websites, software, user-interfaces and tools related to mokens.

1. Foster a Mokens community that achieves the goal and assists people and companys helping the Mokens project.
2. Work with the Mokens comm

## Mokens Project & MIP Purpose

  The purpose of the Mokens project is to create useful and desirable cryptocollectibles and non-fungible tokens that are used for many 
  different things and are used in many projects across Ethereum. The mokens project uses the mokens minted from the Mokens contract.

The purpose of MIPs is assist the moken community and other's to achieve 


We intend EIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Ethereum. Because the EIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For Ethereum implementers, EIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the EIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
